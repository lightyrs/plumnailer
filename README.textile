Compare all of the images on an HTML page and select the one that best
represents what the page is about (for use as a thumbnail for the entire page).

Project is in an early stage and for now just picks the largest image on the
page. More sophisticated scoring coming soon.

require 'plumnailer'

chooser = Plumnailer::Chooser.new
# caching fetcher is good for testing
chooser.fetcher = chooser.img_parser.fetcher =
  Plumnailer::CachingFetcher.new('/tmp/plumnailer-test')

choice = chooser.choose('http://urls.matthewm.boedicker.org/')
puts choice.source_url

choice.resize_to_fill(64, 64).write('thumb.jpg')
